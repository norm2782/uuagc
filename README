To install UUAG, use cabal in combination with Setup.hs

By default, "cabal install" will install UUAGC from the
included Haskell sources. To build from the AG sources
using an existing uuagc installation, use:

cabal install --ghc-options="-DEXTERNAL_UUAGC"

Note: to produce a source release, you'll need to use the
Setup.hs because cabal-install at the time is not able to
do this in combination with the cabal plugin:

--
cabal clean    # remove possible junk
ghc --make Setup.hs -o setup
./setup configure --user
./setup build
./setup sdist
--
