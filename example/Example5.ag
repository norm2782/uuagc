DATA Root
   | Root  tree: Tree

DATA Tree
   | Node  left:  Tree   right: Tree
   | Tip   value: Int

-- A SET declaration is a way to abbreviate sets of datatypes.
-- The name can be used instead of an explicit enumeration of the set
-- in other DERIVING, ATTR and SEM declarations.

SET Every = Root Tree

DERIVING Every: Show

-- We re-introduce synthesized attribute "sum" here for datatype Tree (see Example1).
-- Notice that Tree has two synthesized attributes:
--  * sum: Int            (which is obviously declared)
--  * transformed: Tree   (because Tree is part of the Every set, and SELF in instantiated to Tree)

ATTR Every [ | | transformed: SELF ]
ATTR Tree  [ replacement: Int | | sum: Int ]

SEM Tree
  | Tip   lhs.transformed = Tip @lhs.replacement
          lhs.sum         = @value
  | Node  lhs.sum         = @left.sum + @right.sum


-- In Example4 we initialized the replacement value with "37".
-- But nothing prevents us from letting the replacement value depend
-- on other synthesized attributes, such as the sum.

SEM Root
  | Root  tree.replacement = @tree.sum

-- In effect, we now have defined a two-pass tree traversal.
-- In the first pass, the sum of all values is calculated.
-- In the second pass, the transformed tree is build, using the sum as the replacement value.
-- combined, we have synthesized a tree of the same shape as the original,
-- where every value is replaced by the sum of all values.
-- The nice thing is that you need hardly be aware that this is actually a
-- two-pass traversal.
-- You can freely use synthesized attributes to define inherited attributes,
-- that may in turn be needed to define other synthesized attributes.
-- Your only concern should only be that the dependency is not circular,
-- but whether one, two, or six passes are necessary is automatically determined.
