This is a plugin for the UUAG system.

To use UUAG in combination with Cabal, add a dependency on the packages:
uuagc         -- installs the tool: uuagc
uuagc-cabal   -- installs a cabal plugin that uses uuagc
Note that this package does not have a dependency on uuagc. You can use
this module without having uuagc installed.
(whether this is useful is a different question)

Then write a custom Setup.hs:

--
module Main where

import Distribution.Simple
import Distribution.Simple.UUAGC

compiler = "uuagc"
main = defaultMainWithHooks (uuagcUserHook' compiler)
--

Add extra-source-files: uuagc_options
The contents of this file are options per AG module, as specified
as follows. Write for each AG file:
* Two lines in a file uuagc_options in the root of the package:
   --
   file: "src-ag/Desugar.ag"
   options: module, pretty, catas, semfuns, signatures, genlinepragmas
   --
  The options depend on what you actually want to compile.
* Add an extra source file to the AG file in the cabal file:
    extra-source-files: src/MyProgram.ag
* Add the module to the modules list in the cabal file.
