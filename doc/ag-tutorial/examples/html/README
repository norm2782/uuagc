Example variants:

the final, full, complete ones, though without indexing functionality:
- Html3.ag, plain AG
- Html3HS.ag, AG with Haskell syntax

stripped down version only producing html (0) and levels+counting (1) and TOC (2),
as in the accompanying slides:
- Html0HS.ag, AG with Haskell syntax
- Html1HS.ag, AG with Haskell syntax
- Html2HS.ag, AG with Haskell syntax

Choose one of the above in the Makefile, say nr Html0HS, then
	make
	make test0
will produce the executable ./html, and the testcase will generate test0.html
