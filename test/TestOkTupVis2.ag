-- A grammar that requires two visits, and an attribute w that is needed in both passes
-- and two local attributes p and q, of which p is needed in two passes
-- This is the same as TestOKTupVis1, but now p and q are tupled

-- Both p and q are needed in visit 0.
-- This is compiled incorrectly: the tuple (p,q) is evaluated twice in visit 0.
-- The passing of p to visit 1 through an intra-parameter is done correctly.
