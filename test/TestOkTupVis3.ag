-- A grammar that requires two visits, and an attribute w that is needed in both passes
-- and three local attributes p and q and r, 
--    q is needed only in visit 0
--    p is needed in visit 0 and in visit 1
--    r is needed only in visit 1

-- As in the previous example, the tuple is evaluated twice in visit 0, whereas only once would suffice.
-- It is evaluated a third time in visit 1, appearantly to calculate r.
-- Although p is needed again in visit 1, it is not passed as an intra-parameter as in the previous example.
-- This is probably because it is calcualted again together with r.
